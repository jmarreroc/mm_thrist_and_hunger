Mad Max (2015) Mod that actually have the features:

v0.0.1
- Max gradually lose health over time, as if he’s slowly starving or dehydrating.
The idea is that health decreases passively (e.g., every few seconds), forcing the player to look for food or water to stay alive.
The logic behind it is that the more life you have, the faster you degrade (Comfort makes us weak. And in the desert, there's no room for weakness.)

v0.0.2
- Tweaked and sightly increased the damage Max takes when the car takes damage.
The idea is to prevent you from going crazy with the car w/o sense. Max and his car are one and the same soul; if one suffers, so does the other.
The logic of this feature follows a strategy that balances damage based on the amount of damage and Max's current health.

v0.0.3
- Roguelite feature: Now death has real consequences. Previously, you could die as often as you wanted without any penalty. From now on, when you die, you will lose all your scrap.

v1.0.0
- Sanity Management. Max must now try not to lose his mind, otherwise he will lose all available Griffa points. Discover by yourself how it works
